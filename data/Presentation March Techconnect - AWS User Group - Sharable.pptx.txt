What is GenAI? 
•AI systems that create human-like content from learned 
patterns 
•Foundation models trained on massive datasets 
•Works by processing and predicting sequences of tokens 
•Fundamentally different from traditional rules-based AI 

GenAI Capabilities & Limitation 
Superpowers and Kryptonite 
•Strengths: Content creation, knowledge processing, 
personalization 
•Limitations: Hallucinations, reasoning gaps, context 
boundaries 
•Business transformation potential: 30-50% productivity 
gains in key areas 
•Implementation challenges: Integration, governance, 
observability, skills 

Success Stories 
The Journey Taken 
•Bynder: Reduced Search Time by 75% using Amazon 
Bedrock 
•Crpyto.com: Delivers Accurate Sentiment Analysis in 1 
Second with Generative AI on AWS 
•Ferarri: Advances Generative AI for Customer 
Personalization and Production Efficiency
