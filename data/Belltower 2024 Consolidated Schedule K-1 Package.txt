Silva Syndicate, LPIssued
Notes:
(1) Funds issuing Schedules K-1 include (a) funds holding convertible notes that closed before December 31, 2024,
all of which employ accrual accounting methodology and therefore record accrued interest from the notes as “income,”
but without actual cash receipt; and (b) other funds with taxable income or loss due to an exit event, shutdown,
dividend, distribution or other tax event or election.
(2) Funds not issuing 2024 Schedules K-1 hold equity securities only or otherwise did not incur income or loss in
2024, and thus are not required to issue K-1s.
Belltower is not a tax advisor, and this should not be interpreted as tax advice. Please consult your
accountant or counsel on all tax-related matters.
